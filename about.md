I am a Ph.D. candidate with the [Computational and Biological Learning group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University 
of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/) and advised by 
[Dr Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome). My research focuses on developing probabilistic 
models (typically parameterized by deep neural networks) and associated scalable approximate inference procedures.
See my [publications page](https://gordonjo.github.io/publications/) or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dZvMjdEAAAAJ&hl=en) 
for a list of my papers.

I am particularly interested in developing deep probabilistic models that capture structure existing in specific data modalities,
and exhibit nice behaviours such as sample and parameter efficiency, generalization, and calibrated uncertainties. Much of 
my recent work has focused on meta-learning, which enables fast few-shot generalization. Another theme in my research 
is modelling symmetries in the data, such as by incorporating translation or permutation equivariance. 

In my previous studies I examined applications of machine learning to specific domains such as healthcare and manufacturing. 
Specifically, I examined how machine learning might be useful in prognosis and prediction of ALS progression based on 
clinical trial data. I also worked on a project to develop optimal sampling strategies for quality assurance processes in 
semi-conductor manufacturing environments.
