I am a first year Ph.D. candidate with the Computational and Biological Learning group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Dr Jose-Miguel Hernandez-Lobato. My research is focused on developing complex probabilistic models (typically parameterized by deep neural networks) and associated scalable approximate inference procedures.

Lately, I have been focusing on deep generative models. Recent advances in stochastic backpropagation enable us to efficiently train increasingly complex models. Some notable examples are the variational autoencoder and Bayesian neural networks. In my research I aim to examine how we can design these (and similar) models to enable more efficient learning (data and computational efficiency) as well as learning in more complex settings. I am especially interested in leveraging generative abilities of models to these ends.

In my previous studies I examined applications of machine learning to specific domains such as healthcare and manufacturing. Specifically, I examined how machine learning might be useful in prognosis and prediction of ALS progression based on clinical trial data. I also worked on a project to develop optimal sampling strategies for quality assurance processes in semi-conductor manufacturing environments.

In my spare time I like to cook, run, listen and play music, watch movies etc'. I also love spending time with the best part of me: my beautiful and perfect wife R.C.
