I'll lay out what I see as the important bits of these models, and hopefully provide some intuition as to why they are useful. My motivation will, in particular, focus on meta-learning. I'll start with a brief introduction to meta-learning, which will serve the dual purpose of (i) motivating everything I'll talk about later, and (ii) will allow me to introduce some terminology and objects that we'll need for the rest of the post.\nQuick Background on Meta-Learning Let's first recall what the (supervised) meta-learning setting is. In the standard supervised learning setting, we are often interested in learning / approximating a function ($f$) that maps inputs ($x$) to outputs ($y$). A supervised learning algorithm ($L$) may be considered an algorithm that, given a dataset of such input-output pairs, returns a function approximator ($\\hat f$). If $L$ is a good algorithm, $\\hat f \\approx f$ in some meaningful sense.\nFig. 1: Observations from a nonlinear function are passed to a learning algorithm. In this visualization I am using a Gaussian Process (GP) as the learning algorithm $L$. GPs being probabilistic models, this produces a distribution over $\\hat{f}$.\nIn the meta-learning setting, rather than assuming we have access to one such (potentially very large) dataset, we assume that our dataset is comprised of many tasks, each containing a context set ($D_c$) and a target set ($D_\\tau$). Each of these, in turn, contain a variable number of input-output pairs. Our assumption is that while the mapping between inputs and outputs may differ across tasks, the tasks share some statistical properties that, when modelled appropriately, should improve the overall performance of the learning algorithms.\nSo the goal of meta-learning is to learn to produce the black-box algorithm that maps from datasets to function approximators. In other words, our goal is to use our dataset of tasks to train a model that, at test time accepts new training sets, and produces function approximators that perform well on unseen data from the same task. Intuitively, the meta-learning algorithm learns a learning algorithm that is appropriate for all of the observed tasks. A good meta-learning algorithm results in a learning algorithm that has desirable properties for tasks similar to those in our training set (e.g., produce good function approximators, are sample-efficient, etc\u0026rsquo;). This is where the popular description of meta-learning as learning to learn comes from.\nFig. 2: A large collection of few-shot tasks is provided during meta-training. The meta-learner learns to map few-shot tasks to meaningful predictive distributions.\nOne of the most compelling motivations for meta-learning is data efficiency. Neural networks notoriously require large datasets to learn from. However, it has been observed1 that humans, for example, are able to learn from just a handful of examples. This is a major difference between human intelligence and our current machine learning systems, and an extremely attractive feature to aspire for with our learning systems. Sample-efficient learners would be wildly useful in many applications such as robotics, reinforcement learning, and others. This line of thinking has lead to the sub-field of research called few-shot learning. In this setting, models are only provided a handful of examples of the task they are required to perform. Meta-learning is a particularly successful approach to designing models that can achieve this.\nFig. 3: Two examples of few-shot learning problems. (Left) An example image is shown (in the red box). All images of the same object must be identified from the set on the bottom. (Right) Same setup, now with characters from an alphabet. Images borrowed from [1].\nThe Neural Process Family Let us know focus our attention on the Neural Process (NP) family2. NPs are a recently introduced family of models for probabilistic meta-learning. While there are interesting latent variable variants, in this blog post I'll focus on conditional neural processes (CNPs), which are a simple deterministic variant of NPs.\nCNPs leverage a series of mappings to directly model the predictive distribution at some location of interest ($x_t$) conditioned on a context set. Mathematically, for a Gaussian predictive likelihood we can express this as\n$$ p(y_t | x_t, D_c) = \\mathcal{N} \\left(y_t; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, D_c), \\sigma^2_\\theta(x_t, D_c) \\right), \\tag{1}\\label{eq1} $$\nwhere $x_t$ is the input we wish to make a prediction at, and $D_c$ is the context set to condition on. The computational structure of NPs is best understood from an encoder-decoder perspective: computationally, we can visualize this model as follows:\nFig. 3: Computational diagram of CNPs. On the left, $(x_i, y_i)$ represent the context set. The $e$ block is the encoder, the $a$-circle the pooling operation, and the $d$ block is the decoder. Output is a Gaussian distribution over $y_t$ for the $x_t$ passed to the decoder. Image borrowed from the DeepMind NP repository3.\nNote the important form of the encoder: it first applies the same mapping ($e$) to each of the $(x_i, y_i)$ pairs in the context set, producing a representation ($r_i$). A natural choice is to implement $e$ with a neural network. Then, a pooling operation $a$ is applied to the representations, yielding a single, vector-valued representation of the context set, denoted $r$. This pooling operation is very important, and we'll return to it later. Finally, to make predictions at $x_t$, we concatenate it to $r$, and pass this through our decoder, $d$, which maps to a mean and variance for the predictive distribution. A natural choice for $d$ is also a neural network.\nThat's it! Given a dataset of tasks, we can now train the parameters of the model (the weights $\\theta$ of the encoder and decoder) to maximize the log-likelihood i.e., the $\\log$ of Eq. $\\eqref{eq1}$: $$ \\theta^\\ast = \\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{\\text{argmax}}\\ \\mathbb{E}_\\tau \\left[ \\sum \\log p \\left(y; x, D_c \\right) \\right], $$\nwhere we can take the expectation over tasks $\\tau$ with our dataset, and the inner summation is over $(x_t, y_t)$ pairs in the target set. In practice, at every iteration we sample a batch of tasks from our dataset of tasks, and (if they are not already) partition them into context and target sets. We then pass each context set through $e$ to produce $r$. Each $x_t$ in the target sets is concatenated with $r$, and this is passed through the decoder to get the predictive distribution. The objective function for the iteration is then the sum over the likelihoods in the target sets, averaged across the tasks. This is fully differentiable wrt the model parameters, so we can use standard optimizers and auto-differentiation to train the model.\nBelow, I show the training progression of a simple CNP trained on samples from a Gaussian Process with an EQ kernel after 0, 20, and 40 epochs of training.\nFig. 4: Snapshots from CNP training procedure after 0, 20, and 40 epochs. Each epoch iterates over 1024 randomly sampled tasks.\nOne thing you might immediately notice is that the CNP seems to underfit compared to the oracle GP (by oracle, I mean using the ground truth kernel). On the one hand, this is true: the uncertainty is not tight, even when many data points are observed. One the other hand, the GP has far more domain knowledge (the exact kernel used to generate the data), and so it is not clear how certain the CNP really should be. Regardless, CNPs suffer from a severe under-fitting problem. In my next post, I will explore several interesting additions to the NP-family that are aimed at addressing this issue.\nDeep Sets OK, let's dive a little deeper into the inner workings of the CNP. A useful way to think about them is as follows. Our decoder is a standard neural network that maps $X \\to Y$, with one small tweak: we condition it on an additional input $r$, which is a dataset-specific representation. The encoder's job is really just to embed datasets into an appropriate vector space. CNPs specify such an embedding, and provide a way to train this embedding end-to-end with a predictive model. However, one might ask \u0026ndash; is this the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; form for such an embedding?\nSo the question that really arises is \u0026ndash; what does a function that embeds datasets into a vector space look like? This is quite different from the standard machine learning model, where we expect inputs to be an instance from some space, typically a vector space (feature vectors, images, etc\u0026rsquo;), or at worst \u0026ndash; sequences (e.g., for RNNs). Here what we want is a function approximator that accepts as inputs sets.\nWhat are the properties of sets, and what properties would we want such a function to have? Well, the first problem is that sets have varying sizes, and we would like to be able to handle arbitrarily-sized sets. The second key issue is that, by definition, sets have no order. As such, any module operating on sets must be invariant to the order of the elements to be considered valid. This property is known as permutation invariance, and is a key concept in the rapidly growing literature on modelling and representation learning with sets.\nNow, this is a bit of sticky situation: on the one hand, we've declared that sets have no ordering. On the other hand, I am now stating that our module must be invariant to their ordering. The resolution to this stickiness is that in practice, our algorithms must operate on representations of sets, and must process these sequentially. Thus, it would be more accurate to say that we are construcing modules that process ordered tuples, and we require that they be permutation invariant, which is equivalent to treating the ordered tuples as sets.\nThe $\\rho$-sum Decomposition It turns out that NPs were not the first model to bump into this question. The Neural Statistician4 and PointNet5, to name a few examples, also considered the problem of representing sets, and proposed a similar solution to CNPs. This form has been dubbed the sum decomposition, or Deep Sets. For a set $S$, it is computed as follows \\begin{equation} \\hat{f}(S) = \\rho \\left( \\sum_{s \\in S} \\phi (s) \\right),\\tag{3}\\label{eq3} \\end{equation}\nwhere $\\phi$ maps elements of $s$ to a vector space $\\mathbb{R}^D$, and $\\rho$ maps elements of $\\mathbb{R}^D$ to $\\mathbb{R}^M$. Note that this is a more general form of the NP computational graph: in Fig. 3, $e$ plays the role of $\\phi$, and $d$ is (a conditional version of) $\\rho$. Here the pooling operation ($a$ in Fig. 3) is implemented as a sum. This was also the operation chosen in the Neural Statistician and PointNet. However, the role of this operation is to enforce the permutation invariance, and as such, any permutation invariant pooling operation (such as mean or max) would also be suitable in place of the sum.\nZaheer et al. (2017)6 provided a more rigorous treatment of the issue. Their key theorem demonstrates that (with a few important caveats) any function on sets has a representation of the form of Eq. $\\eqref{eq3}$. Some caveats are that $\\phi$ and $\\rho$ must be universal approximators of their function class (motivating the use of neural networks). An important caveat is, when the elements of $S$ are drawn from an uncountable set (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^m$), the theorem was only proven for fixed-size sets. So just shy of the varying-sized requirement.\nDespite the caveats on the theory, Zaheer et al. provide a remarkable result towards characterizing the approximation capabilities of Deep Set networks, and justify their usage in a wide range of machine learning problems.\nSummary I'll wrap this post up here. We have taken a first look at the Neural Process family of models for probabilistic meta-learning, and looked at the key role that representation learning on sets plays in this model class.\nThe modelling of sets is an important and fascinating subfield at the frontier of machine learning research. Personally, I am drawn to this topic due to its role in meta-learning, a topic which is near and dear to my heart. Indeed, one perspective on the meta / few-shot learning lines of research is as learning to flexibly condition models on small sets of data, and of course, Deep Sets have a key role to play in that perspective.\nNeural processes take just this approach. Arguably the most straightforward perspective of CNPs is as simple predictors parameterized by DeepSet networks, trained with maximum-likelihood. Yet this simple approach has proven extremely powerful. The original papers show that this class of models is capable of providing strong probabilistic predictions, and perform very well in the low-data regime. Requeima et al.7 run with this view, and adapt CNPs to the large scale, few-shot image classification setting, demonstrating very strong performance (full disclosure, I am an author on that paper). Finally, there have been several recent advances in this class of models that has increased their capacity and addressed their susceptibility to underfitting. These will be the topic of my next post on Attentive8 and Convolutional9 CNPs.\nReferences    Brendan Lake et al.

Before diving in, let me briefly describe the setting first, as the best way to understand amortized variational inference (in my opinion) is in the context of regular variational inference (VI).\nQuick background on VI Let’s assume that we have some latent variable model, such that for every data-point $x$ there is a corresponding local latent variable $z$. VI is applicable more generally than this setting, but this is scenario provides a good intuition for how and why VI works. We are interested in the posterior distribution of the latent variable conditioned on the observations $p(z | x)$, which is crucial to “learning” in such a model. For simple models, we can apply Bayes’ rule directly to get this distribution. For more complicated models, this is unfortunately intractable.\nThe basic premise in VI is to approximate this intractable distribution with a simpler one that we know how to evaluate and handle. We refer to this simpler distribution as the approximate posterior, or variational approximation, and denote it $q$. Typically, this will be from some parametrized family $\\mathcal{Q}$, e.g., Gaussian. We can then optimize the parameters of this simple distribution (sometimes referred to as variational parameters) w.r.t. an appropriate objective function (this is called the ELBO, which is a lower bound on the log-marginal likelihood of the observed data). This is equivalent to finding the distribution in the specified family closest (in the KL-divergence sense) to the true posterior 2. The beauty of this is that we have substituted intractable posterior inference with optimization, which is something we can generally do at scale (especially with the introduction of stochastic VI3).\nPractical issues with VI What does this mean, practically? For a Gaussian posterior approximation, we would introduce a mean and variance parameter for every observation, and optimize all of these jointly. Two problems to notice with this procedure. The first is the number of parameters we need to optimize grows (at least) linearly with the number of observations. Not ideal for massive data-sets. The second is that if we get new observations, or have test observations we would like to perform inference for, it is not clear how this fits in to our framework. In general, for new observations we would need to re-run the optimization procedure.\nAmortizing Posterior Inference Amortized VI is the idea that instead of optimizing a set of free parameters, we can introduce a parameterized function that maps from observation space to the parameters of the approximate posterior distribution. In practice, we might (for example) introduce a neural network that accepts an observation as input, and outputs the mean and variance parameter for the latent variable associated with that observation 45. We can then optimize the parameters of this neural network instead of the individual parameters of each observation. That’s it — that’s what amortized VI is.\nWhat’s great about this? Notice that this directly addresses the issues mentioned earlier. First, the number of variational parameters is now constant w.r.t. to the data size! In our example, we need only specify the parameters of the neural network, and that is not dependent in any way on the number of observations we have. Second, for a new observation, all we need to do is pass it through the network, and voila, we have an approximate posterior distribution over its associated latent variables! At the constant cost of a forward pass through a network!! These gains are the source of the term amortized.\nIs this a free win? No, of course not — that’s almost always a rhetorical question. A common misconception is that since this distribution is generated by a neural network, it is somehow more expressive than the original framing. Quite the opposite; the amortized posterior approximation is less expressive than its free-form counterpart. The approximate posterior is still Gaussian, but now there is an additional constraint imposed by requiring that all the variational parameters lie in the range of the network. Within a specific parametric family, nothing is more general than freely optimizing the variational parameters. This cost is known as the amortization gap6. For a network with infinite capacity, this gap goes away, and we can be (only) as good as the free-form optimization setting. Of course, that is not the case in any practical implementations, as all networks have finite capacity.\nRegardless of this drawback, amortized VI represents a significant advancement in probabilistic machine learning, and has opened the door to massive improvements in both modelling and inference.\nOriginally a Quora answer.\nReferences    Zhang, Cheng, et al.

The debate is rather high-level, but in my opinion touches upon something that is at the very core of research in the field. In this post I will lay out the fundamental aspects of the debate as I see them, and try and give my personal perspective on the issue.\nConnectionist, Gradient Based Learning  Undoubtably the most dominant trend in ML at the moment is deep learning - i.e., learning that is based on neural networks and their offspring achieved by applying gradient-based methods (error-back propagation, a.k.a backprop). DL has led to some undeniably outstanding successes, achieving human-level (or better) performance in specific tasks such as object recognition, speech (recognition and synthesis), and game-playing. This in turn has led to wide-spread adoption and integration of DL technologies in many leading tech companies, and has generated a lot of media hype and public recognition.\nDespite these impressive successes, there are major drawbacks to DL. The obvious problems are terrible data-efficiency and an inability to generalize across tasks or domains. Both of these characteristics arise from the fact that neural networks are at their core pattern matching machines. Essentially, they find complex patterns in massive datasets that correlate with a desired output. Often, these patterns may correspond to interesting notions of underlying structure in the data (i.e., edges in an image), lending to the notion of representation learning. However, these representations are highly specified for specific tasks, and training a network for a new task must be done from scratch. This can be frustrating since we often intuitively know there must be transferable knowledge between the tasks. An example of this is the phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting1, where performance of a trained network on task A will deteriorate significantly when trained for related task B. Essentially, every time we train a neural network we must do so (pretty much) from scratch, even if there are many shared components that should be leveraged.\nA Real-World Counter Example  Given the recent successes of DL and gradient-based learning, and the impressive ability of generic neural networks to learn meaningful representations, should we in fact consider alternative approaches? Well, we have a biological counter-example of general intelligence that works - humans. As many have pointed out, artificial flight was achieved when humans moved away from biological inspirations. This is a valid point, and I do not believe we should limit our investigation of intelligent systems to mimicking human intelligence. On the other hand, human intelligence provides an excellent benchmark for measuring performance of artificial systems and a source from which to draw aspirations.\nIn context of this post, we observe that humans learn rich representations that generalize across complex tasks from very few examples. For instance, given a single visual example of a new object, humans easily infer high level traits such as its purpose, decomposition into parts and the relations between them, and how it may interact with different environments (image and motivation taken from2). They can then use these traits to classify new visual examples of the object, draw (or imagine) variations on the object, or think of uses for it. All of this from observing a single example.\nThe presence of these traits in human intelligence serves both to highlight the drawbacks of neural-network based learning and perhaps indicate that DL alone will not be sufficient to achieve significant progress towards more general intelligence. Further, (though I am no neuroscientist), there seems to be sufficient evidence it is highly unlikely the brain is composed of sets of generic, single purpose neural networks3.\nLake et al.3 argue that the ability of humans to learn such complex representations of new concepts given little data is due to the existence of models that allow humans to leverage their past experiences to do so. They go on to argue that important characteristics of these models are the presence of fundamental learning structures from early age (e.g., intuitive physical and psychological knowledge), causality, and compositionality. Importantly, none of these are characteristics of DL.\nThe Heart of the Debate Given what is discussed above, we can now ask the central question, which is exemplified in two recent papers34: how much emphasis should we place on encoding knowledge into our models?\nThe Case for Model-Free ML  Among the main proponents of learning from scratch and largely model free ML are researchers at Google DeepMind, who authored [4]. DeepMind are responsible for some of the most noteworthy successes of DL such as mastering Atari games5 and Go6. These successes have been achieved with advances in model-free systems. Indeed, the only inductive biases introduced in these systems is that of standard convolutional nets for parsing images. As discussed in [4], there are (at least) two significant arguments against incoporating and encoding prior knowledge into our models.\nThe first has to do with the notion of generality (not generalization). For many domains, prior or expert knowledge may not be available, or may be intractable to encode. For instance, physical laws can provide important prior knowledge in domains such as robotic movement, and the model-based approach justifies leveraging that knowledge. This may indeed improve performance of deployed systems. However, in many domains (e.g., healthcare, dialogue systems) such knowledge may not be so straight-forward to include. How would a general model-based approach towards intelligence then deal with these domains? To quote Botvinick et al.4:\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; it is not clear that detailed knowledge engineering will be realistically attainable in all areas we will want our agents to tackle\u0026quot;.\nWith this in mind, generic models that make no prior assumptions on the domain and \u0026ldquo;learn from scratch\u0026rdquo; may be more generally applicable to a wider range of areas.\nThe second point has to do with avoiding encoding our own biases into intelligent agents. The knowledge and inductive biases that Lake et al.3 argue should be included in our intelligent models are specifically human. There is no reason to believe that these principles are required (let alone optimal) for machines to be intelligent. Indeed, encoding incomplete notions of inductive biases in an attempt to mimick the human brain may hinder progress, much as attempting to achieve artificial flight by mimicking birds proved unproductive. Proponents of model-free learning argue that by starting from a \u0026lsquo;blank slate\u0026rsquo;, machines generate representations and inductive biases that are useful to them for the specified task. From this view, learning from scratch is a feature rather than a bug.\nProponents of the model free approach argue that in fact we should avoid encoding knowledge into our models for the reasons specified above. Existing problems in neural networks, such as data efficiency and transferability, can be solved within the context of DL and do not require prior/expert knowledge. Recent advances in DL (such as memory or attention mechanisms, deep generative models) are indeed steps in these directions, though it is not clear that these will solve the core issues.\nHow Much is Really Gained by Models?  The main motivation for heavily engineered models is achieving human-like learning: rich, generalizable representations of complex concepts with little examples. However, is it clear that encoding knowledge into models can actually achieve this? Below I discuss an example that shows how heavily engineered models can indeed get around some of the major difficulties of DL.\nGame-Playing with Minor Environmental Variations Mnih et al.5 famously show that a single deep RL algorithm can achieve human-level performance on a wide range of Atari games using only the screen pixels as input. This is a very impressive achievement, and one that has been subsequently improved upon. However, Kansky et al.7 point out a major flaw of those deep RL agents: minor variations in the environment completely break performance.\nIn other words, the \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo; gained by the agent while learning to play the original version of the game is so specific that any variation to the environment (including ones that humans easily adapt to) is a completely new domain and the agent must be retrained. Clearly, this is unsatisfying, and we desire our agents to be more general than this.\nThe authors go on to propose schema networks; complex graphical models that model objects, their movements and attributes, and causal relations between actions/objects/reward. This allows the agent to perform long term planning (phrased as inference) after training. The paper then details experiments showing that schema networks easily adapt to the variations in environment that break the deep RL agents.\nBeside causal relations, the schema network model encodes knowledge on intuitive physics, namely that objects are smooth, and contain physical attributes relating to movement, size, etc. This paper demonstrates how encoding fundamental principles of causality and physics can enable models to be more robust to changes (as well as learn more efficiently).\nFor interested readers, other excellent examples of how models improve both data-efficiency and generalization can be found in [2, 8].\nMy Own Two Cents  Personally, I find this debate fascinating, and at the very core of what AI and ML research are all about. Both sides make compelling points, and it is not clear to me that one is correct. My natural inclination leans more towards the modeling perspective: I believe that intelligence has much to do with (probabilistic) models, and whether or not these draw inspitation from human intelligence, I cannot imagine an intelligent agent that is completely model free.\nHowever, I see no reason for the two approaches to be mutually exclusive (this notion is also emphasized by Lake et al.3). Much of the most interesting recent work has been on teaching neural networks to perform probabilistic inference. This is where I believe the most interesting and promising work currently lies: bridging the gap between DL and model-based ML. Neural networks are incredibly powerful tools, and integrating them into the toolbox of probabilistic modelling holds enormous potential.\nFurther, a potential goal is to merge model-based and model-free ML. My opinion is that, where possible, we should encode (fundamental) notions such as physics and theory of mind into our models, and neural networks can provide flexible mappings for complex relations. Where no such expert knowledge exists, latent variable models with neural network parameterizations can provide a powerful avenue to allow systems to learn abstract concepts from scratch. Ideally, these notions can co-exist within single systems.\nAs in many debates, my hunch is that the most progress can be made by integrating both sides, trying to take the best of both worlds.\nReferences    Goodfellow J., Ian, et al.

All the approaches to few-shot learning I am aware of use probabilistic modelling. In fact, one of the reasons I’m so sold on Bayesian learning is that it offers avenues to pursue these problems - its not clear to me how one can even approach this not from a probabilistic perspective.\nA Discriminative Approach  An interesting paper1 by Rich Turner's group (in collaboration with Bernard Scholkopf's group) proposed using the representations found in the final hidden layer of a deepNet to generalize to unseen classes for classification.\nBy placing a prior on the weights they can perform posterior inference on the values for a new class, and show impressive results using very simple priors and likelihood functions. This is the only discriminative approach I am familiar with, and I think it shows a lot of promise for future work.\nGenerative Models for Few-Shot Learning  More common are the use of generative models. These can largely be placed on a spectrum of how structured the models are.\nUnstructured Models On one end of the generative spectrum are completely unstructured models [2, 3]. Here, researchers attempt to learn meaningful representations in latent variables, and then make use of that ‘information’ for new tasks. This has shown good results, even though optimal mechanisms for information sharing are not yet clear. A lot of interesting work is being done here.\nHeavily Structured Models On the other hand are heavily structured models [4, 5, 6]. These works come from a faction of ML researchers who believe we should encode as much knowledge as possible into our models [7]. For example, in Kansky et al.5 show how a heavily engineered model can transfer its capabilities to unseen scenarios in game playing, something that state of the art deep RL agents are catastrophically bad at.\nThere is a tradeoff here: structured models achieve very impressive generalization, sample efficiency, and few-shot capabilities. It is clear that by encoding knowledge we can achieve significant gains in these aspects. On the other hand, this entails expert knowledge and the ability to encode it in a computationally tractable manner. This is obviously not possible for all domains, and it may not be a scalable approach to improving AI [8]. Conversely, unstructured generative modelling relieves the burden of human engineering, which is a clear goal of ML. However, it is not clear how to guide the latent variables towards useful representations, nor is it clear what is the ‘right’ way to then transfer this knowledge.\nOne interesting recent paper9 proposes a method for encoding known axes of variation in partially observed variables while allowing latent variables to capture unknown axes of variation. The paper proposes a general approach for variational inference in these models. I believe this approach of finding the middle ground of the spectrum will be very influential in the near future.\nOriginally a Quora answer\nReferences    Bauer, Matthias, et al.

For many reasons this is unsatisfactory. One reason is that it lacks proper theoretical justification from a probabilistic perspective: why maximum likelihood? Why just point estimates? Using MLE ignores any uncertainty that we may have in the proper weight values. From a practical standpoint, this type of training is often susceptible to overfitting, as NNs often do.\nOne partial fix for this is to introduce regularization. From a Bayesian perspective, this is equivalent to inducing priors on the weights (say Gaussian distributions if we are using L2 regularization). Optimization in this case is akin to searching for MAP estimators rather than MLE. Again from a probabilistic perspective, this is not the right thing to do, though it certainly works well in practice.\nThe correct (i.e., theoretically justifiable) thing to do is posterior inference [1, 2], though this is very challenging both from a modelling and computational point of view. BNNs are neural networks that take this approach. In the past this was all but impossible, and we had to resort to poor approximations such as Laplace’s method (low complexity) or MCMC (long convergence, difficult to diagnose). However, lately there have been some super-interesting results on using variational inference to do this [3], and this has sparked a great deal of interest in the area.\nBNNs are important in specific settings, especially when we care about uncertainty very much.

I've been working with variational autoencoders and Bayesian neural networks. If you've read the literature on these training procedures and models, you probably found the descriptions quite complete. When I implemented these models however, I found that quite a lot of elbow grease is required to get them to work well.\nFrom talking to some other researchers here, it seems like people dealing with these models are thirsty for practical advice. In this post, I will provide some background on the subject, and highlight some tips and hacks that really helped me with successful implementation.\nDeep Generative Models  We are considering the case where we have some complex latent variable model (later we will see how we can consider the weights as our latent variables and extend these ideas to BNNs) as shown below.\nHere, \\(x\\) are our inputs, \\(z\\) are the latent variables, and \\(\\theta\\) parameterizes the conditional distribution. Usually, we use deep neural networks to map from \\(z\\) to \\(x\\), so \\(\\theta\\) will be the parameters of the network. This is a very powerful family of models known as deep generative models (DGMs), even for very simple distributions of \\(z\\). What we would like to do is perform learning (i.e., maximum likelihood or a-posteriori estimation) for \\(\\theta\\), and inference for \\(z\\). Unfortunately, the posterior distribution for \\(z\\) is intractable, so something like EM would not work for us here.\nVariational Inference for DGMs  The best approach seems to be variational inference (VI). The basic idea with VI is to introduce an approximation to the true posterior, which we`ll call \\(q\\), and parameterize it with the variational parameters - \\(\\phi\\). To do this, we need to first choose some parameteric family for \\(q\\), such as a Gaussian. Having chosen \\(q\\), the idea is to minimize the distance between the true posterior and our approximation. The minimization is over \\(\\phi\\) and with respect to some divergence between distributions, such as the KL-divergence. Once we've optimized \\(q\\), we can use it instead of \\(p\\) whenever we need the posterior distribution. The variational objective can be expressed as:\n\\begin{equation} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\phi; x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x)||p(z)) \\end{equation}\nwhich has a nice interpretation: the first term can be seen as reconstruction error - we are trying to maximize the likelihood of the data under the latent variable. The second term can be interpreted as a regularizer - it encourages the approximation to be as simple as possible by penalizing it for being different from the prior on \\(z\\), which is typically chosen to be something simple like a standard normal distribution.\nWhat's fantastic about VI is that it allows us to convert inference from an integration problem (which we pretty much suck at) to an optimization one (which we are awesome at). On the flip-side, there are a few drawbacks: one problem is that we are usually limited to very simple posterior approximations, and the quality of our trained model is directly related to the quality of \\(q\\). Another problem is that posterior inference includes a separate set of variational parameters \\(\\phi\\) for every data-point, and therefore needs to be recomputed for every new example we receive.\nInference Networks and Reparameterization  To get around these problems, some guys had the brilliant idea of introducing an inference network. The idea is to use a neural network to learn \\(q\\). Ideally, we would train both networks \\(\\theta, \\phi\\) jointly. The main advantage of this is that it ammortizes posterior inference, so that while the number of latent variables grows linearly with the number of data points, posterior inference now has fixed computational and statistical complexity. This seems great, but of course, there are still some problems.\nTo train the things, we would like to use our regular stochastic gradient optimizers. The KL term in \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) can often be evaluated analytically, especially for the standard choices of distributions. The difficult term is the reconstruction error, which is pesky because it is under expectation of the approximate posterior, which is intractable. However, we can use Monte-Carlo to approximate it:\n\\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}[\\log p(x|z)] = \\int q(z|x) \\log p(x|z)dz \\approx \\frac{1}{L}\\sum\\limits_{l=1}^L \\log p(x|z^l) \\end{equation}\nwhere we are sampling \\(z^l \\sim q\\). Alas, the problem is that sampling for \\(z\\) means that \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}\\) is not differentiable w.r.t. \\(\\phi\\), so we cannot train the inference network. Another idea might be to directly sample the gradient \\(\\nabla_{\\theta, \\phi}\\mathcal{L}\\). Unfortunately, Paisley et al.1 show that \\(\\hat{\\nabla}_{\\phi} \\mathcal{L}\\), while unbiased, has very high variance, and training as such tends to diverge more often than not.\nLuckily, some papers from a few years ago (2, 3) fleshed out how we could get around this using an almost embarrasingly simple trick - reparameterization. The idea here is to introduce a random variable \\(\\epsilon\\) that will contain all of the randomness in \\(z\\) for us. We now set up a new variable \\(\\tilde{z}\\) such that:\n\\begin{equation} \\tilde{z} = g_{\\phi}(\\epsilon, x);\\ \\ \\tilde{z} \\sim q(z|x);\\ \\ \\epsilon \\sim p(\\epsilon) \\end{equation}\nso all we need is that \\(g_{\\phi}\\) be differentiable and be able to sample from \\(p_{\\epsilon}\\). This is almost always possible, and in many cases it is even super-easy. For example, if:\n\\begin{equation} q(z|x) = \\mathcal{N}(z; \\mu(x), \\sigma^2(x)) \\end{equation}\nwith \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) being parameterized by neural networks, then:\n\\begin{equation} p(\\epsilon) = \\mathcal{N}(\\epsilon; 0,1);\\ \\ g(\\epsilon, x) = \\mu(x) + \\epsilon \\otimes \\sigma(x) \\end{equation}\nwhere I am using \\(\\otimes\\) to denote an element-wise multiplication. Reparameterization, simple though it may appear, does two amazing things. (1) It manipulates \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}\\) such that it is differentiable w.r.t. \\(\\phi\\) - we can now jointly train the inference network and the model! (2) It allows us to reduce the variance of the estimator by sharing random numbers across terms and iterations. This may not be the only reason, but regardless, \\(\\nabla_{\\theta,\\phi}\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}\\) exhibits low variance, and in practice converges very nicely. For a more detailed explanation of how and why reparameterization works, I strongly recommend Carl Doersch's excellent tutorial (4).\nStochastic Backpropagation  So that's it. We're ready to put it all together in an algorithm called Auto-encoding Variational Bayes (2), or Stochastic Backpropagation (3) (the thing was concurrently discovered and published by two separate groups). Conveniently, we can run this optimization in mini-batch form, so basically its just stochastic gradient descent with your favorite optimizer on the estimator described above. Just for closure, here is the complete algorithm (in rough pseudo-code):\nfunction stochastic_backprop(data, L): theta, phi \u0026lt;- initialize_variables() repeat: x_batch \u0026lt;- data.next_batch() eps_l \u0026lt;- peps.sample() for l in range(L) gradient \u0026lt;- L(x_batch, eps_l).eval_gradient(theta, phi) theta, phi \u0026lt;- optimizer.update(gradient) until convergence (theta, phi) return theta, phi  Of course, this is very rough psuedo code that is not meant to run. Perhaps in a future post I will go into detail with one model (VAE), and will run through a TensorFlow implementation (including code) with toy data. There I can also discuss how the exact same algorithm can be used to train a BNN, and run through a TF implementation of that with the same data.\nReferences    Paisley, John, Blei, David M, and Jordan, Michael I.
