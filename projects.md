### [Semisupervised and Active Learning with Deep Generative Models](https://github.com/Gordonjo/generativeSSL) 
We developed a deep generative model that has a discriminative component. The idea is to leverage the generative aspects of the model to enable learning about the structure of the data, while also leveraging the model for supervised tasks. 

Since after training the model is used for classification (rather than the variational approximation), we can express model uncertainty. This in turn can be used for active learning, which can potentially increase data-efficiency even further.

### [A Machine Learning Analysis of ALS](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7899957/) 
    
    ALS is a devastating neuro-muscular disease characterized by wildly varying manifestations across patients. The variation in the symptoms and progression rates makes both treatment and clinical research extremely challenging. In this research project we develop and apply models and pipelines that predict disease progression rate based on [PRO_ACT](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT), a clinical trial database. We further propose clustering methods based on disease progression patterns, and demonstrate how the clusters may be used to gain insights into the disease and improve prediction performance.
