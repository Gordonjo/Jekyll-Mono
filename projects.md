### [Semisupervised and Active Learning with Deep Generative Models](https://github.com/Gordonjo/generativeSSL) 
We developed a deep generative model that has a discriminative component. The idea is to leverage the generative aspects of the model to enable learning about the structure of the data, while also leveraging the model for supervised tasks. 

Since after training the model is used for classification (rather than the variational approximation), we can express model uncertainty. This in turn can be used for active learning, which can potentially increase data-efficiency even further.
